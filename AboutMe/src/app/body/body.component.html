    <h2>Hi, I'm Namit ðŸ‘‹</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a curious and creative web developer who loves building beautiful user experiences. My work is focused on creating fast, accessible, and responsive websites using modern tools like Angular, TypeScript, and SCSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in writing clean, reusable code and continuously learning new tech. When I'm not coding, you'll find me reading design blogs, sketching UI ideas, or experimenting with animations and micro-interactions.
